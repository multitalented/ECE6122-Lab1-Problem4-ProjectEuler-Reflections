Reflections in a White Cell:

This program uses a starting value for a point on an ellipse that represents the entrance/exit of a white cell
in which a laser enters the cell at a particular angle. The second point is given for the first reflection.
This program calculations the number of times the laser reflects within the cell before it exits the cell.
This problem was worked out geometrically with the use of tangent identities, and the analytical solution
on paper is given in the submission of this assignment on Canvas.

The resulting number of reflections is output to a file calling Output4.txt

Example execution in command line:

~$  g++ .\*.cpp a.exe

~$  a.exe

~$ cat Output4.txt

354
